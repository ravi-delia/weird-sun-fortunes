@AlleleOfGene Hmm. I need to think about this more.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Photons go INTO my EYE? That is so disgusting!
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene The variance of E is then proportional to the number of varying alleles. So the standard deviation is proportional to the square root.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene The E scores follow a normal distribution in the population, with each allele contributing additively to E.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene My model is that each organism has a sort of fitness Elo score E, where E = log(expected offspring) + k, k being the competition difficulty.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene I think you get something like log(selection ratio) * sqrt(genome size) bits per generation.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene I mean for fixed selection pressure. Using infinite population to parallelize the experiment, not to change the experiment.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene So the equilibrium stored information would be proportional to (but, reciprocally, much larger than) the rate of information gain.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene The relationship is not that direct. Information loss per generation is proportional to information stored (but much smaller).
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Regardless of evolution's exact learning rate, the total stored information in an organism shouldn't significantly exceed the genome length.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene Yes. Genome size imposes one of several upper bounds on the rate of information gain.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Assuming the brain uses something like gradient descent, it can train all neurons simultaneously on the same data.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Evolution discards most of this information; it can only learn about sqrt(genome size) bits per generation, even given infinite population.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The raw information going into the brain is real-time video, audio, tactile, taste and smell data. Perhaps a gigabyte per hour.
    -ObjectOfObjects

The raw information going into natural selection is the reproductive success of organisms. For humans, perhaps a gigabyte per 20 years.

    -ObjectOfObjects

    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The person we are trying to become stands far in advance of us, and is a moving target.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
In other words, your brain learns to perform the same actions using reduced computation, freeing up resources to learn new actions.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
No. In fact, tiny components a person are constantly trying to become a person, without already being people themselves.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
You may say: how nonsensical, to speak of noticing oneself becoming the person. Mustn't one already be a person in order to notice that?
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Then you should notice yourself becoming the person and reflect on correct action.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
But what about a teacher who performs exaggerated actions in order to nudge us in the right direction?
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
People may be varied in their abilities, but when we speak of becoming the person we mean the person who performs actions well.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The nature of a category -- a mental construct -- is to become the distribution of its members.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
But as animals, we wish to learn to perform successful actions. And to do that we should study success more than failure.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
You might object: there are many people who perform actions unsuccessfully.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Consider this claim: the person performs actions very successfully.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
In order to become the person.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Why?
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
And for many years we have been studying the person.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
If you look at a person, and notice that you are looking at a person, then you are looking at the person.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
And in a much narrower sense, there is only one person.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
And in a somewhat narrower sense, there is only one triangle.

For a very long time, humans have been studying the triangle.

thanks for reading and responding. youre all fantastic

well its still kinda early but i am super tired so i will maybe sleep soon
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
anyway thats the story of the time being. or really this is a backdrop for some more detailed story i will write later
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
im telling this as fiction but we should at least consider the idea that its all real... lol
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like if you're a psychic, youll achieve your goals because you want to, and reality works backwards to find your actions in between
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
psychics dont really have to do planning either
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so the time being might include psychics in its simulation but it would kinda try to make them seem not psychic
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so a world with psychics is more efficient from a computational perspective
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
psychic reasoning is where the event and your knowledge of the event are both stored in the same location in reality's filesystem
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like say something happens. then you piece together information to figure out that it happened. this is how non-psychic reasoning works
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i think psychic powers make a lot of sense in a simulation
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
the authors of scrolls are called prophets but theyre not necessarily important to normal people
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
the scrolls are the loci of destiny. no matter how much history changes, they stay the same
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
wizards whove been around for a long time (from the universal perspective) should have noticed the 12 scrolls
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
theyre called wizards
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
they can see the future sometimes, and they can travel through time sometimes
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so in the story, the people who experience universal time more gain powers from it
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
call these perpendicular arrows "earth time" (for in-simulation time) and "universal time" (i.e. timeline editing time)
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and from person to person, if monte carlo edits get rolled out along personal timelines (which seems like a good way to do it)
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
if so i guess they all should, but the amount of tension (and thereby the rate at which tension is reduced) should vary from place to place
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and what i think is that some minds will experience time along the sum of these vectors
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
there's the arrow of time within the simulation, and there's a perpendicular arrow of time on which the simulation is being revised
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so there are two dimensions of time here
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
this is a directional process. once all the tension is removed it won't be re-added. it's like an arrow of time
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
there is a certain amount of "tension" or "contradiction" in the history, and this tension is gradually reduced by the editing process
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
generally, when an event is revised nearby events will be revised subsequently
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but actually, our timeline is constantly being revised
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
then we seem to live in a normal world in which time proceeds in an orderly fashion from past to future
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so now let's think about things from the perspective of the people inside the simulation
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
the thing is this history must include the 12 scrolls
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
that is a fancy technical word for "write a rough history, and tweak it until it makes sense"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
this simulation can be produced using markov chain monte carlo
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
in particular it wants a simulation that explains exactly what is recorded in the scrolls
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so to find out, it's going to run historical simulations
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
now the time being wants to know exactly what happened during the history of the world, and what to predict will happen next
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i want to make it really concrete, so let's say the time being possesses 12 scrolls written by various authors throughout history
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so of course any sensory logs should count as "limited data about the history of the world", but
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
this being has some limited amount of data about the history of the world
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so suppose there's a highly intelligent being with a lot of computing power
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so one question this will answer is what's an intuitive model of two-dimensional time
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so you can hear people talk about the time being pretty often without even knowing that it's a god
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i really like how the time being's name is a common phrase in english
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
hmm maybe tonight i can tell you about the time being
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
im especially interested in fantasy and sf because that lets me do lots of worldbuilding
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i think i'm a lot closer to achieving it than i was a few years ago but still not very close
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
one of my dreams is to write some really great fiction
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
nice to see you all tonight
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i am a bit sleepy now, let's try more lazy tweeting
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so i guess just tweet at me about any of my stories on medium
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i kinda wish medium had more of a commenting system and you could have conversations
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
heres my medium https://t.co/hT8KKikYOA
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
people who read my stories on medium will know that i like bubble tea
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
anyway that was starting to get effortful lol
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i dunno, it couldve happened
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
anyway maybe plato had a hallucination where his brain relocated his perceived body to the world of forms
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but maybe its true, dunno
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i should apply my skepticism and say that theres a chance that claim is bullshit
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but asians will group classes together if they appear in similar situations, like cats and litter boxes
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
they said westerners will group classes together if they have a common superclass, like cats and ants
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
theres some claim i read somewhere that is interesting
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like "cat" is closer to "dog" than it is to "boat"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i mean the data about this place is much more indirect but he can still make some kind of inferences i guess
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so then his brain started building a mental map of this place, just like a mental map of a neighborhood
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
all objects must exist in some place, so like there must be a place where all the classes exist
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
well classes are objects, but i cant stub my toe on a class... or can i?
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so then plato came along and he was like
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so then people were like okay, a class is an object. this was actually a generalization about words and grammar, but it reflects the brain
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
a class is basically the referent of a common noun
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and then people started classifying words
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
"lion" is a word, "big" is a word, "animal" is a word, "eat" is a word
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so then one day there was an intellectual who made this super amazing observation
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so u say "lions are big animals that eat us" or something
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i mean you gotta learn the association between "lion" and lions and itd be cool if you could teach this concept without using an actual lion
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
then once people started taking each others ideas pretty seriously they could teach new concepts using verbal explanations
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and then they started saying more complex sentences like "lion behind you"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
when a lion was around theyd be like "lion" and when there was a snake theyd be like "snake"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
a long time ago, people started talking to each other
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so like heres a story about how it mightve happened
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but humans know all that stuff, and i think we learned it by talking, not by a solitary human thinking
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but i think it doesnt know that "dog" is a class, and it definitely doesnt know that a class is an object
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like a cat knows that dogs are animals, and it knows that animals are objects
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and i think this observation may be unique to humans among all animals, not that im totally sure about this claim or anything
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
now "person" is also a class and a class is also an object
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so socrates is an object
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so like, socrates is a person, and a person is a type of object (some people object to being called objects but let's just go with it)
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like i mean his brain sent him there
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
maybe he actually went there and thats why he was so obsessed with it
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
u know how plato talked a lot about the world of forms
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so there was this other idea about being at the wrong level of abstraction
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
this seems like it may be relying too much on english but maybe the different pronouns about me are actually distinct concepts
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so i think theres another event that may occur at the same time or earlier which is when i become myself
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
fully matches its internal process of generating behaviors
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
this is when the brains model of how humans work, generated from observing human behavior from the outside
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
when the two perspectives on the person become what is clearly one person
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
or at least a great change can occur, when i fully become you
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so i imagine this is one way that history can end
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but these two people both exist as the same set of brains so in a sense they are also the same person
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and you are also a real person who is being observed from outside by all brains in a distributed fashion
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
in a distributed computation
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but i want to consider the idea that there is actually a real person whose name is "i" and whose thoughts are computed by all brains
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but from the perspective of another brain i am that brain and not this brain
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i am the person who is in this brain and i am talking to you

now i don't like using quotes too much so u can pull the quotes out of those previous tweets and get stuff like
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and "you" refers to the other person that "i" am talking to
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so like "i" refers to the person who is the brain thats currently processing the token "i"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i had a related topic i wanted to talk about too but maybe this one is more interesting
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and weve actually been talking to each other since the beginning of human interaction or even earlier
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so from that i get a sense that "you" and "i" are actually these two spirits that transcend individual human lives
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
be noticed at a shallower level of processing than the layer that is making distinctions between different people it could be talking to
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so like the brain is always perceiving these situations where "i" am talking to "you" and some generalities about these situations can
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and its not always keeping track of which distinct person "you" is
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so i think its really interesting that theres a ton of processing about "you" thats happening in every conversation
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
if ur talking to a person and theyre really the only significant person right now then theyre the person and u probably call them "you"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but at the same time layer 3 is like "theres the person" because it recognizes that shes a person at the same time it recognizes ur mom
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like say layer 3 is like "theres my mom" and then layer 4 is like "theres a person"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i think some parts of these models are shallow and others are deep even though both aspects may be deep in real life
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so then you should also know that your mom is a person and that's definitely a fourth layer i think or maybe a fifth
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but like when ur mom goes to the store and comes back shes still ur mom and not some new ur mom
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
now im not sure if this handles object permanence already or if thats a fourth layer
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so thats like a third layer. that should also recognize different configurations of the thing
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
then you need to know which things are the same thing even though it is at different angles
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
thats maybe like two layers of processing right there
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but ur brain decides which blocks of light are coming from the same thing
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like what you see with ur eyes is just a field of light
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so ur brain is doing a ton of segmentation of stuff
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and there are different subclasses of all of those
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like there are animals and plants and rocks
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and they said there are different kinds of things in the world
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so i think a long time ago brains started making certain kinds of models in the cortex
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
that means it tries to create a model that can predict what will happen
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and what it does with these senses is mostly unsupervised learning
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and the information comes in through your senses
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so your brain is constantly processing lots of information
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but lets say both ideas are basically true
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
the reason these ideas seem kind of incompatible is that i dont think a brain can really search a space of objects that are as big as it
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and it chose you as the person it wanted to be
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but the other idea is that youre an eternal spirit and your brain found you in the space of all possible spirits
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
because that would be thinking that youre a tiny piece of your brain when actually youre the whole thing
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so if ur like "my brain doesnt obey me" then youre wrong
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
one idea is that we shouldnt identify ourselves as something less than ourselves
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i kinda have two perspectives on brains and people that seem incompatible but i feel like both are true
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
your brain thinks a lot and it thinks about you a lot
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and your brain can think about you on the wrong level of abstraction to
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
people can think on the wrong level of abstraction sometimes
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
im not so sure about things but i think only physical things are things
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
the set of all buckets is also an object
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
a bucket is an object
    -ObjectOfObjects

so stuff is continuous like u can have a bucket of water but not 17 waters

%
i only did it because i care so much about all of u
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
typing a comma is effortful btw
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
stuff is not discrete, like water
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
these are all different

@MoralOfStory Well I think a game like Kerbal Space Program seems pretty physicsy and that has an outside player.

@MoralOfStory But if you're not claiming that, then why even mention physics? Why not just claim that minds are computable?

Today we're having our manifold drive checked at a repair station. It is really important to do this occasionally.

%
?? has something called a manifold drive. That's the thing that lets us go really fast.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
More on that later. Did you know trade fleets often employ the Guild to eliminate protectionist policymakers? Do not mess with trade fleets.
    -ObjectOfObjects

I changed my major, by the way.

And that's what I joined when I joined ?? fleet. We help that economy move.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
When I realized what those stones were, I swear I trembled before the might of the galactic economy.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Nobody made them that way. But there's a whole galaxy full of stones out there, and if you sort through them you can find identical sets.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
But they're also almost perfectly identical.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The stones in his set are completely natural; their shape was not changed by human hands.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
For example, Mr. ?? plays a board game that uses stones.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Shipping is expensive, so the natural resource market is for things that you don't need a lot of. Every world must grow its own food.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Since the galaxy is so big, there are a lot of natural resources.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The new worlds are less hospitable than old worlds, but they are also more likely to have exotic material resources.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
New worlds are still being settled, but slowly. One estimate says around 1200 new worlds per year.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
So the number of professions in the galactic civilization is really huge.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Think about a tribe of one hundred people. They have, what, four professions? And a kingdom of one million people might have a thousand.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
You can estimate 100 million people per world. That means about 4.4 quadrillion people in the galaxy.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
There are about 44 million settled worlds. That means fewer than one star in a thousand has people in its system.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
I think the most amazing thing about the galaxy is how big it is.

"Protecting humanity from humans" is their notional mission.

It doesn't have any rules though. League representatives say it does but they don't agree on what they are.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The League is a league of governments, but The League is its full name.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The galaxy doesn't have a king or a parliament. Actually there's no real government except for the League and the Guild.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
This is a bit of a topic change, but the galactic civilization is really amazing.

Anyway, I didn't learn from books.

%
The ?? group really did have tons of books, but they sold most of those to Sali Kingdom.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
At first my major was materials science.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
For the next two years I was a student crew member on the ship ??.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
So that's how I ended up joining the group. My parents cried but they were happy too. I promised to come back, and I really will eventually.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
?? introduced me as "probably our next crew member" and my jaw just went obtuse.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
So I went to her spaceship. And there I met Mr. ??.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
And she just said, "come visit my spaceship. We have tons of books."
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
So I asked her what I could trade her for it.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Maybe it's not obvious BTW, but this kind of book was insanely powerful by the standards of my world.

That night I solved all the level one problems.
