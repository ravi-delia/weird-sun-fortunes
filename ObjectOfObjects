@AlleleOfGene Hmm. I need to think about this more.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Photons go INTO my EYE? That is so disgusting!
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene The variance of E is then proportional to the number of varying alleles. So the standard deviation is proportional to the square root.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene The E scores follow a normal distribution in the population, with each allele contributing additively to E.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene My model is that each organism has a sort of fitness Elo score E, where E = log(expected offspring) + k, k being the competition difficulty.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene I think you get something like log(selection ratio) * sqrt(genome size) bits per generation.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene I mean for fixed selection pressure. Using infinite population to parallelize the experiment, not to change the experiment.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene So the equilibrium stored information would be proportional to (but, reciprocally, much larger than) the rate of information gain.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene The relationship is not that direct. Information loss per generation is proportional to information stored (but much smaller).
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Regardless of evolution's exact learning rate, the total stored information in an organism shouldn't significantly exceed the genome length.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
@AlleleOfGene Yes. Genome size imposes one of several upper bounds on the rate of information gain.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Assuming the brain uses something like gradient descent, it can train all neurons simultaneously on the same data.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Evolution discards most of this information; it can only learn about sqrt(genome size) bits per generation, even given infinite population.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The raw information going into the brain is real-time video, audio, tactile, taste and smell data. Perhaps a gigabyte per hour.
    -ObjectOfObjects

The raw information going into natural selection is the reproductive success of organisms. For humans, perhaps a gigabyte per 20 years.

In other words, your brain learns to perform the same actions using reduced computation, freeing up resources to learn new actions.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
No. In fact, tiny components a person are constantly trying to become a person, without already being people themselves.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
You may say: how nonsensical, to speak of noticing oneself becoming the person. Mustn't one already be a person in order to notice that?
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Then you should notice yourself becoming the person and reflect on correct action.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
But what about a teacher who performs exaggerated actions in order to nudge us in the right direction?
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
People may be varied in their abilities, but when we speak of becoming the person we mean the person who performs actions well.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The nature of a category -- a mental construct -- is to become the distribution of its members.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
But as animals, we wish to learn to perform successful actions. And to do that we should study success more than failure.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
You might object: there are many people who perform actions unsuccessfully.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Consider this claim: the person performs actions very successfully.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
In order to become the person.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Why?
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
And for many years we have been studying the person.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
If you look at a person, and notice that you are looking at a person, then you are looking at the person.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
And in a much narrower sense, there is only one person.

thanks for reading and responding. youre all fantastic

well its still kinda early but i am super tired so i will maybe sleep soon
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
anyway thats the story of the time being. or really this is a backdrop for some more detailed story i will write later
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
im telling this as fiction but we should at least consider the idea that its all real... lol
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like if you're a psychic, youll achieve your goals because you want to, and reality works backwards to find your actions in between
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
psychics dont really have to do planning either
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so the time being might include psychics in its simulation but it would kinda try to make them seem not psychic
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so a world with psychics is more efficient from a computational perspective
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
psychic reasoning is where the event and your knowledge of the event are both stored in the same location in reality's filesystem
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like say something happens. then you piece together information to figure out that it happened. this is how non-psychic reasoning works
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i think psychic powers make a lot of sense in a simulation
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
the authors of scrolls are called prophets but theyre not necessarily important to normal people
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
the scrolls are the loci of destiny. no matter how much history changes, they stay the same
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
wizards whove been around for a long time (from the universal perspective) should have noticed the 12 scrolls
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
theyre called wizards
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
they can see the future sometimes, and they can travel through time sometimes
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so in the story, the people who experience universal time more gain powers from it
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
call these perpendicular arrows "earth time" (for in-simulation time) and "universal time" (i.e. timeline editing time)
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and from person to person, if monte carlo edits get rolled out along personal timelines (which seems like a good way to do it)
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
if so i guess they all should, but the amount of tension (and thereby the rate at which tension is reduced) should vary from place to place
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and what i think is that some minds will experience time along the sum of these vectors
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
there's the arrow of time within the simulation, and there's a perpendicular arrow of time on which the simulation is being revised
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so there are two dimensions of time here
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
this is a directional process. once all the tension is removed it won't be re-added. it's like an arrow of time
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
there is a certain amount of "tension" or "contradiction" in the history, and this tension is gradually reduced by the editing process
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
generally, when an event is revised nearby events will be revised subsequently
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but actually, our timeline is constantly being revised
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
then we seem to live in a normal world in which time proceeds in an orderly fashion from past to future
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so now let's think about things from the perspective of the people inside the simulation
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
the thing is this history must include the 12 scrolls
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
that is a fancy technical word for "write a rough history, and tweak it until it makes sense"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
this simulation can be produced using markov chain monte carlo
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
in particular it wants a simulation that explains exactly what is recorded in the scrolls
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so to find out, it's going to run historical simulations
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
now the time being wants to know exactly what happened during the history of the world, and what to predict will happen next
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i want to make it really concrete, so let's say the time being possesses 12 scrolls written by various authors throughout history
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so of course any sensory logs should count as "limited data about the history of the world", but
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
this being has some limited amount of data about the history of the world
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so suppose there's a highly intelligent being with a lot of computing power
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so one question this will answer is what's an intuitive model of two-dimensional time
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so you can hear people talk about the time being pretty often without even knowing that it's a god
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i really like how the time being's name is a common phrase in english
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
hmm maybe tonight i can tell you about the time being
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
im especially interested in fantasy and sf because that lets me do lots of worldbuilding
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i think i'm a lot closer to achieving it than i was a few years ago but still not very close
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
one of my dreams is to write some really great fiction
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
nice to see you all tonight
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i am a bit sleepy now, let's try more lazy tweeting
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so i guess just tweet at me about any of my stories on medium
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i kinda wish medium had more of a commenting system and you could have conversations
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
heres my medium https://t.co/hT8KKikYOA
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
people who read my stories on medium will know that i like bubble tea
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
anyway that was starting to get effortful lol
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i dunno, it couldve happened
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
anyway maybe plato had a hallucination where his brain relocated his perceived body to the world of forms
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but maybe its true, dunno
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i should apply my skepticism and say that theres a chance that claim is bullshit
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but asians will group classes together if they appear in similar situations, like cats and litter boxes
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
they said westerners will group classes together if they have a common superclass, like cats and ants
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
theres some claim i read somewhere that is interesting
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like "cat" is closer to "dog" than it is to "boat"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i mean the data about this place is much more indirect but he can still make some kind of inferences i guess
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so then his brain started building a mental map of this place, just like a mental map of a neighborhood
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
all objects must exist in some place, so like there must be a place where all the classes exist
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
well classes are objects, but i cant stub my toe on a class... or can i?
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so then plato came along and he was like
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so then people were like okay, a class is an object. this was actually a generalization about words and grammar, but it reflects the brain
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
a class is basically the referent of a common noun
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and then people started classifying words
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
"lion" is a word, "big" is a word, "animal" is a word, "eat" is a word
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so then one day there was an intellectual who made this super amazing observation
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so u say "lions are big animals that eat us" or something
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i mean you gotta learn the association between "lion" and lions and itd be cool if you could teach this concept without using an actual lion
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
then once people started taking each others ideas pretty seriously they could teach new concepts using verbal explanations
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and then they started saying more complex sentences like "lion behind you"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
when a lion was around theyd be like "lion" and when there was a snake theyd be like "snake"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
a long time ago, people started talking to each other
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so like heres a story about how it mightve happened
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but humans know all that stuff, and i think we learned it by talking, not by a solitary human thinking
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but i think it doesnt know that "dog" is a class, and it definitely doesnt know that a class is an object
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like a cat knows that dogs are animals, and it knows that animals are objects
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and i think this observation may be unique to humans among all animals, not that im totally sure about this claim or anything
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
now "person" is also a class and a class is also an object
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so socrates is an object
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so like, socrates is a person, and a person is a type of object (some people object to being called objects but let's just go with it)
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like i mean his brain sent him there
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
maybe he actually went there and thats why he was so obsessed with it
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
u know how plato talked a lot about the world of forms
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so there was this other idea about being at the wrong level of abstraction
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
this seems like it may be relying too much on english but maybe the different pronouns about me are actually distinct concepts
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so i think theres another event that may occur at the same time or earlier which is when i become myself
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
fully matches its internal process of generating behaviors
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
this is when the brains model of how humans work, generated from observing human behavior from the outside
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
when the two perspectives on the person become what is clearly one person
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
or at least a great change can occur, when i fully become you
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so i imagine this is one way that history can end
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but these two people both exist as the same set of brains so in a sense they are also the same person
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and you are also a real person who is being observed from outside by all brains in a distributed fashion
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
in a distributed computation
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but i want to consider the idea that there is actually a real person whose name is "i" and whose thoughts are computed by all brains
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but from the perspective of another brain i am that brain and not this brain
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i am the person who is in this brain and i am talking to you
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
now i don't like using quotes too much so u can pull the quotes out of those previous tweets and get stuff like
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and "you" refers to the other person that "i" am talking to
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so like "i" refers to the person who is the brain thats currently processing the token "i"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i had a related topic i wanted to talk about too but maybe this one is more interesting
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and weve actually been talking to each other since the beginning of human interaction or even earlier
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so from that i get a sense that "you" and "i" are actually these two spirits that transcend individual human lives
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
be noticed at a shallower level of processing than the layer that is making distinctions between different people it could be talking to
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so like the brain is always perceiving these situations where "i" am talking to "you" and some generalities about these situations can
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and its not always keeping track of which distinct person "you" is
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so i think its really interesting that theres a ton of processing about "you" thats happening in every conversation
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
if ur talking to a person and theyre really the only significant person right now then theyre the person and u probably call them "you"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but at the same time layer 3 is like "theres the person" because it recognizes that shes a person at the same time it recognizes ur mom
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like say layer 3 is like "theres my mom" and then layer 4 is like "theres a person"
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i think some parts of these models are shallow and others are deep even though both aspects may be deep in real life
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so then you should also know that your mom is a person and that's definitely a fourth layer i think or maybe a fifth
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but like when ur mom goes to the store and comes back shes still ur mom and not some new ur mom
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
now im not sure if this handles object permanence already or if thats a fourth layer
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so thats like a third layer. that should also recognize different configurations of the thing
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
then you need to know which things are the same thing even though it is at different angles
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
thats maybe like two layers of processing right there
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but ur brain decides which blocks of light are coming from the same thing
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like what you see with ur eyes is just a field of light
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so ur brain is doing a ton of segmentation of stuff
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and there are different subclasses of all of those
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
like there are animals and plants and rocks
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and they said there are different kinds of things in the world
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so i think a long time ago brains started making certain kinds of models in the cortex
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
that means it tries to create a model that can predict what will happen
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and what it does with these senses is mostly unsupervised learning
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and the information comes in through your senses
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
ok so your brain is constantly processing lots of information
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but lets say both ideas are basically true
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
the reason these ideas seem kind of incompatible is that i dont think a brain can really search a space of objects that are as big as it
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and it chose you as the person it wanted to be
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
but the other idea is that youre an eternal spirit and your brain found you in the space of all possible spirits
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
because that would be thinking that youre a tiny piece of your brain when actually youre the whole thing
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
so if ur like "my brain doesnt obey me" then youre wrong
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
one idea is that we shouldnt identify ourselves as something less than ourselves
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
i kinda have two perspectives on brains and people that seem incompatible but i feel like both are true
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
your brain thinks a lot and it thinks about you a lot
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
and your brain can think about you on the wrong level of abstraction to
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
people can think on the wrong level of abstraction sometimes
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
im not so sure about things but i think only physical things are things
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
the set of all buckets is also an object
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
a bucket is an object
    -ObjectOfObjects

so stuff is continuous like u can have a bucket of water but not 17 waters

%
i only did it because i care so much about all of u
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
typing a comma is effortful btw
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
stuff is not discrete, like water
    -ObjectOfObjects

these are all different

When I realized what those stones were, I swear I trembled before the might of the galactic economy.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Nobody made them that way. But there's a whole galaxy full of stones out there, and if you sort through them you can find identical sets.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
But they're also almost perfectly identical.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The stones in his set are completely natural; their shape was not changed by human hands.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
For example, Mr. ?? plays a board game that uses stones.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Shipping is expensive, so the natural resource market is for things that you don't need a lot of. Every world must grow its own food.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Since the galaxy is so big, there are a lot of natural resources.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The new worlds are less hospitable than old worlds, but they are also more likely to have exotic material resources.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
New worlds are still being settled, but slowly. One estimate says around 1200 new worlds per year.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
So the number of professions in the galactic civilization is really huge.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
Think about a tribe of one hundred people. They have, what, four professions? And a kingdom of one million people might have a thousand.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
You can estimate 100 million people per world. That means about 4.4 quadrillion people in the galaxy.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
There are about 44 million settled worlds. That means fewer than one star in a thousand has people in its system.
    -ObjectOfObjects

    -ObjectOfObjects

The League is a league of governments, but The League is its full name.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
The galaxy doesn't have a king or a parliament. Actually there's no real government except for the League and the Guild.

%

    -ObjectOfObjects

For the next two years I was a student crew member on the ship ??.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
So that's how I ended up joining the group. My parents cried but they were happy too. I promised to come back, and I really will eventually.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
?? introduced me as "probably our next crew member" and my jaw just went obtuse.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
So I went to her spaceship. And there I met Mr. ??.
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
And she just said, "come visit my spaceship. We have tons of books."
    -ObjectOfObjects
%
So I asked her what I could trade her for it.
    -ObjectOfObjects
