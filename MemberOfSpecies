    -MemberOfSpecies

@Meaningness Such neglect is "unethical" in the sense that philosophical ethics is against it,
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness A mix of utilitarianism and ethical egoism doesn't have supererogation, just irrational neglect of the egoist component.
    -MemberOfSpecies

@Meaningness I guess I'm trying to think of a case where the question makes intuitive sense, but at the same time there's no supererogation.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness What if it represents a theory that's a mix of utilitarianism and ethical egoism?
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness I guess the intuition is that the "should" here doesn't actually represent theories like utilitarianism and deontology.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness But it seems like considerations are similar for e.g. how much one should follow rules at one's own expense.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness They're likely to have uncertainty between theories and maybe mixtures of theories.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness I agree that when people ask the question, they're thinking at a higher level of abstraction than utilitarianism in particular.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness Yes, my story just now fails to make sense of this intuition if donating kidneys doesn't hurt you more than it helps others.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness And in messy practical situations, it can be very unclear what it means to be pulled too far or not far enough toward altruism.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness And the question here makes sense, because utilitarianism advocates more altruism than is typical, but not infinite altruism.

%
@Meaningness E.g. "How ethical [pulled toward altruistic] should [according to utilitarianism] I [who am inclined to be egoistic] be?"

@Meaningness and asking how strongly they should be so pulled before it causes them to overshoot the ethical-philosophically best action.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness but being pulled in other directions like altruism or rule-following by moral reflection,
    -MemberOfSpecies

@Meaningness When people ask "how ethical should I be", maybe they're modeling themselves as acting on base motives by default,

@Meaningness (I forget where I was going with that, but I'll leave it up to clarify what I meant by a different sense of "ethical".)

@Meaningness But it's not the case that taking the money is merely above a lower bound of ethical adequacy. It's the best thing to do.

    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness I'm not sure. I'm rusty on the official ideas/terminology. Priors are against people's ideas being both new and correct.
    -MemberOfSpecies

@Meaningness I've never been able to understand this perspective; "ethical" (in the sense used here) just seems like it means "shoulded".

@Meaningness its best strategy won't be "do the single best thing and I'll reward you maximally, or else I'll punish you maximally".)

@Meaningness (To the extent the utilitarianism hypothesis is an agent that you interact with psychologically and are punished/rewarded by,

@Meaningness Intuitions around "compulsory"/"forbidden" come from conflict between agents. The words seem misleading applied to theories.

    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet I.e. more disparate between the people with a high nonrandom part of the predictor and the people with a low nonrandom part.
    -MemberOfSpecies

@aprayerofquiet and then I'm not sure that it's still true that impact gets more disparate for higher thresholds.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet as itself containing a random component
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet and in this model, high-predictor people suffer from zero false negatives, so maybe you'd want to model the predictor
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet I think to measure disparate impact, you'd have to compare false negatives between groups instead of false + vs false -
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet i.e. "reject more people with bad predictors but good outcomes than accept people with good predictors but bad outcomes"
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet does that sound like what you had in mind?
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet "because your standards for predictors are high and most people fail them, even though many would reach okay outcomes"
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet "and because of this, you'll reject a lot more people with bad predictors but good outcomes than the other way around"
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet "especially when outcome predictors only weakly predict outcomes"
    -MemberOfSpecies

@aprayerofquiet Or is the shape difference in tweet 9 due to the different units on the axes?

    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet Argh, sorry, that was a typo for "top right and bottom left".
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet Are the top right and bottom right diagrams the same but with the axes translated?
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet So what happens is that the cloud gets translated along its diagonal axis, right? That accords with what my intuition was.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet I think the point would be less confusing if the X and Y axes had the same scale.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet And that isn't already the diagonal axis of the cloud?
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet I mean, "SW" in the sense of following the cloud's diagonal axis.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet And then I don't see where the asymmetry would come from.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet So then it feels as though shifting the distribution of independent variables west should just shift the whole thing SW.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet the dependent variable is the sum of the independent variable and a random normal error
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet My math brain doesn't seem to be online right now but it seems like in a real situation it would be something like
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet I think I was talking past you for reasons unrelated to that, anyway.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet I'm confused: the independent variable and predictor variable both refer to the x axis, right?
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet Also, I meant "dependent" where I said "independent".
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet On reflection, I'm no longer sure that I'm talking about the same statistical point that you were making.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet And the failure to gather sufficient information can be caused by pure bias, although one can commit that error both ways.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet Yes, strongly disparate impact can also be evidence of the failure to gather sufficient information.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet And when group differences are small, you can avoid the disparate impact with small sacrifices in expected ind. variable.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet And then it depends on the tradeoff of those other consequences vs. getting the best expected value of the ind. variable.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet "other" meaning other than via false positives/negatives, which despite the disparity expectedmaximize the agent's criterion
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet I guess it depends on the degree to which disparate impact is intrinsically bad and/or causes other bad consequences.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@aprayerofquiet "disparate impact out of proportion with average differences is not strong evidence of pure bias or unfairness"
    -MemberOfSpecies

@themattsimpson @GrumplessGrinch It means that once you know about gravity, the final cause no longer gives you new info and is "used up".

    -MemberOfSpecies

@simplic10 @Meaningness I meant actual cats.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@simplic10 @Meaningness Yes, and the thing that makes it so can be pointed at as an abstraction in the world, just like cats.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@simplic10 @Meaningness Maybe such objective probabilities can be said not to exist, but only in the sense cats can be said not to exist.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@simplic10 @Meaningness Which seems like it makes it useful to have the concept.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@simplic10 @Meaningness But there's a large class of situations where we learn the "objective probability" in this sense but not everything.

@simplic10 @Meaningness (Of course, if we knew *literally everything*, we'd have to assign either 100% or 0%.)

    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@themattsimpson @GrumplessGrinch I feel like I'm stepping into an entrenched battle about whether it's okay to use Aristotelian terminology
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness And it seems like we should be able to talk about causes even in a deterministic universe that fundamentally has no probability
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness Pearl's program defines causes in terms of patterns of conditional probability, right?
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness has reason to point at some structural features and say that they constitute objective probabilities.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness So maybe there's an analogue of this in math, where the facts are one definite way, but a subjectively uncertain agent still
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness And this is true even if I subjectively think the symmetrical coin has a 70% probability of heads.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness There's a sense in which a symmetrical coin objectively has a 50% probability of heads even in a deterministic universe.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@themattsimpson @GrumplessGrinch In other words, maybe you could say the final cause is exhausted by a simple-to-describe efficient cause.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@themattsimpson @GrumplessGrinch So one thing about rocks is "rocks tend downward" adds no information to "gravity pulls rocks down".
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@themattsimpson I'd need to think harder to have a definite opinion but those also sound like degenerate cases.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness This feels like sweeping the problem under the rug. We have uncertainty about mathematical facts with conditional structure.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness And this is true even if a superintelligent mind could derive the sociological facts from first principles.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness Then I think you could say something like, "if the sociology had worked out differently, we could have had a larger group".
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness Hmm. So let's say you had a claim like "for complicated sociological reasons, large groups of people cooperate less well".
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@GrumplessGrinch @themattsimpson If you zoom in, there are only efficient causes, but then again, if you zoom in, there are no tigers.
    -MemberOfSpecies

@GrumplessGrinch @themattsimpson Sure. Either way, the optimization target causes the features, at some level of abstraction.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@Meaningness I think people use counterfactuals of that form a lot, only the mathematical facts are a lot more complicated than 5x5=26.
    -MemberOfSpecies

@Meaningness "If 5x5 had been 26, this 5x5 room would have been 26 square meters" doesn't make zero sense to me.

%
@Meaningness I guess I'm trying to figure out whether there's a principled reason for saying such things aren't causal.
    -MemberOfSpecies

@themattsimpson I mean, lexicographic preferences are a degenerate case that can't possibly occur in the real world, right?

@themattsimpson Maybe not with real numbers. Non-real numbers are weird, but so are lexicographic preferences.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@themattsimpson Yet it seems like there are final causes in evolution. (Not fundamentally, but on the same level where e.g. humans exist.)

%
@themattsimpson I wouldn't call such things "preferences".

@Meaningness "The fact that 5*5=25 and the fact that the room is 5x5 meters, together, cause the room to be 25 square meters."

@themattsimpson Is evolution an example of something that sort-of maximizes a utility function, but doesn't predict the future?
    -MemberOfSpecies

@themattsimpson Utility maximization captures a part of human behavior. If it didn't capture any part, would humans still be agents?

@themattsimpson (Aside from the point of whether it's a utility function we share?)
    -MemberOfSpecies

@themattsimpson Is the objection "not all things that predictably move to somewhere are best characterized as moving to a utility optimum"?
    -MemberOfSpecies

@themattsimpson Does "purpose" and "agenthood" mean "systematic optimization toward a utility function"?
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@themattsimpson Yes, the backward causation objection doesn't seem to hold.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
If that's something you're allowed to do, it seems like a natural place for formal and final causes to live.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@themattsimpson probability structure can be the same for mathematical as physical facts.

    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@etarletons @willdoingthings LW seems weirdly resistant to reforming the karma system from first principles AND to experimenting with it.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
None of these would affect comment score or karma, but they would be counted, and even purely neutral votes would be meaningful information.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
As long as I'm dreaming, it would be nice to also have neutral-agree votes, neutral-disagree votes, and purely neutral votes.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@willdoingthings So maybe people will just pick the one that reduces karma score instead of the one they actually mean.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@willdoingthings I guess a lot of the time one out of "bad"/"not good" is going to directly reduce karma score and the other isn't.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
@willdoingthings You can't tell the difference between "I was downvoted because someone thought I was upvoted too much"/"someone hates me".
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
It would just be nice to be able to take carrots away from people who don't deserve them without hitting them with sticks.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
If that can be solved, I think the system is better than what LessWrong currently uses, both hedonically and incentives-wise.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
Potential issue: if badness is psychologically stronger than goodness, maybe people will strategically vote "not bad" instead of "good".
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
Just to be clear, in this system, goodness would just show as 0 until more voters said "good" than "not good". Same with badness.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
Starting these comments at -1 would mildly disincentivize chaff without making people feel rejected or attacked by a concrete person.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
Whereas merely bland comments would get many "not good"/"not bad" votes and remain hopelessly stuck at a score of zero.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
In theory, but maybe not in practice, legitimately controversial comments would have many "good"/"bad" votes, few "not good"/"not bad".
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
The advantage of such a system is people don't end up feeling punished when enough people actively think they're harmless.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
Four voting options: good, bad, not good, not bad.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
This isn't the same thing as an upvote if people pay attention to the upvote/downvote ratio as well as the total.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
A comment system that lets you negatively downvote comments, canceling out the next downvote by a different person.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
Maybe badness mostly lies in adding worthless noise, which harms many people a small amount, which means downvotes track it badly.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
Maybe if goodness is more objective and badness is more subjective, it makes sense to represent badness by individual unfollows/nonfollows.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
Maybe an upvote-only mechanism (like Twitter) makes it harder to remember that statements can be actively harmful.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
So maybe it makes it harder to remember that things can be good in multiple ways, and makes people ignore the less obvious ways.
    -MemberOfSpecies
%
Maybe an upvote/downvote mechanism encourages evaluation by the first simple binary criterion that comes to mind, like agree/disagree.
