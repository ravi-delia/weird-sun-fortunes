When the next word arrives, the word passes on its message.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
The word awaits the next word, and that's all that is.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
But let's get back to the word-centered view.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
The state of the zero cell after observing the last word determines whether the input is accepted.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
The zero cell observes one word of the input sequence on each time step.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
The initial state has finitely-many nonempty cells.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
There are a finite set of cell states.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
Each tape cell may react to its immediate neighbors, so this is a cellular automaton. The empty cells with empty neighbors remain empty.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
DCFGs are presumed boring so we will grant the automaton infinitely-many processors, one per auxiliary tape cell.

Q: Does an infinite-in-both-directions auxiliary tape-having automaton that computes one step per input have the same power as a PDA?
    -InstanceOfClass
%
A thousand mathematicians on Twitter with really short attention spans who can only talk to each other.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
If the automaton is single-threaded and deterministic then we are left with a deterministic context-free grammar.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
The previous statement is only interesting if the automaton's memory is unbounded, so we allow this.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
The automaton should compute its next state in a single step.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
But consider that automaton. It moves forward through the sequence of words. At each step it holds a finite amount of information.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
The sequence of words is being processed by some automaton. But that is not the word-centric view either.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
Back to the word-centric view. Suppose each word holds a finite amount of information which it passes onto its successor.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
The reason for considering a long sequence of words in isolation is that it is easy to acquire a long sequence of words in isolation.
    -InstanceOfClass
%
We immediately object that linguistics is not just the study of a long sequence of words.
    -InstanceOfClass

Giants could sympathize with civilizations because their own needs are as large as those of a civilization.

Software could be used to connect modalities in specific ways. One player could describe things verbally so another player visualizes them.

One reason is because we can also think at the speed of light. A localized computation can complete more iterations per second.
    -InstanceOfClass

Okay, but in the future we can communicate at the speed of light. So why have such a local consciousness?
    -InstanceOfClass

Then you may be an "em", living among the clouds in a vast computer network.

Yes, it would make sense to be a large being, because they have more being to be. But suppose we are not in that anthropic realm.
    -InstanceOfClass

    -InstanceOfClass

But if that doesn't make sense to you, suppose you were in the future.

We could be in that universe right now. Why wouldn't cells be conscious?

@MikeAnissimov Philosophers examine and systematize their intuitions. Without this step, it would be too early to dismiss the intuitions.

@MikeAnissimov Extracting predictions from a theory can be a lot of work. Someone has to examine the theory.

and i am pretty sure he brings his younger siblings along too and they're all crying because reunion
    -InstanceOfClass

so the whole movie is like an hour and a half and it ends with the ram guy joining up with the rocket guy's party
    -InstanceOfClass
%
i know there's someone else in this party but having a hard time bringing up the image, don't think i really got to know that character yet
    -InstanceOfClass

the flying girl looks kinda like carter from stargate but like 24 years old. hm guess it's not a party of teenagers exactly, mostly tho
    -InstanceOfClass

the ram guy looks kinda like edmund from the 1988 lion witch &amp; wardrobe
    -InstanceOfClass

the rocket guy looks kinda like cyber from 10k commotion
    -InstanceOfClass
%
the ram guy joins with them and i am not sure what happens to his little siblings
    -InstanceOfClass
%
she can't always fly though
    -InstanceOfClass

there are like 2-3 other people in the rocket guy's adventuring party including the flying girl who is blonde
    -InstanceOfClass
%
like he was protecting them from the evil adults but at the same time he thought being with them was safer than a journey with swords
    -InstanceOfClass
%
and he's friends with the ram guy but they got separated because he went adventuring and the ram guy was protecting his little siblings
    -InstanceOfClass
%
and he has a really big sword (why am i even saying this)
    -InstanceOfClass
%
he's black and the rocket is black too (this means nothing)
    -InstanceOfClass

so there's this one teenager that turns into a rocket kinda like the guy in she-ra

it's also related to this other movie that i had already seen and hard to understand which of the two movies comes first

my friends m.v., a.t., d.d. all cried while watching this movie but i didn't believe i would cry but i did like twice

there's this one little girl that's scared of this boy because he turns into a scary thing and he's trying to come through the door and
    -InstanceOfClass
%
i don't think the time loop is exactly the same every time and i am not sure what their later experiences are
    -InstanceOfClass

and the other teenagers never even joined this insular tribe because they are out journeying with their swords trying to save everybody
    -InstanceOfClass
%
and the good adults are protecting the children and everyone is just trying to stay alive and the ram guy is a teenager
    -InstanceOfClass

in which there is this tribe of like 30 people 20 of whom are adults, 12 of whom do not how to be civil to children
